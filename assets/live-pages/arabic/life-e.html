<p>There's so much more to the Monash study experience than lectures and class work.</p>

<p>Monash believes strongly in social justice. It's a philosophy we instil in all of our students and has led to a culture of volunteerism that permeates the entire university.</p>

<p>We also accommodate a huge number of student societies, as well as sporting and social clubs.</p>

<h2>Volunteering</h2>

<p>Many of our students find that by working without thought of reward, the rewards naturally come. They develop the sort of skills in leadership, negotiation, teamwork and analysis that can only come from hands-on experience. By making a difference to the lives of others, they make a difference to their own lives.</p>

<p>Monash has developed close links with leading aid organisations Oxfam Australia and World Vision. Our students have also been inspired to start up their own volunteer organisations. These include Embrace Education, a volunteer organisation promoting equal access to education in Melbourne, and the Oaktree Foundation, an aid and development organisation run by people under the age of 26 who have joined the United Nations campaign to end global poverty.</p>

<p>In addition to volunteering opportunities, many Monash degrees offer real world experience through industry placements that give students on-the-job experience.</p>

<h2>Clubs and societies</h2>

<p>Some of the opportunities and experiences that Monash University offers don't take place in the classroom; they come via the many clubs and societies that students are able to join.</p>
<p> Joining a club or society will not only help students make new friends and
  make their time studying at university more enjoyable, but it will help to
  develop skills which can have a positive influence on future employment.</p>
<h2>Leadership programs</h2>
 
<p>Monash has a reputation for producing leaders. This is a product of our academic excellence and our unique educational model, and we complement it with specific leadership programs aimed at bringing the best out of talented students. One of these is the Ancora Imparo Leadership Program.</p>

<h2>Ancora Imparo Leadership Program</h2>
 
<p>The Vice Chancellor's Ancora Imparo Program has been designed to help passionate and idealistic students prepare for future leadership roles. The program involves theoretical and case study components, discussions, debates and seminars. Many of the seminars are led by distinguished Australian leaders and students have the opportunity to meet a range of high profile community leaders.</p>

<p>The name of the program comes from the university's Latin motto. Ancora Imparo means "I am still learning".</p>

<h2>Committees</h2>

<p>Students can elect to nominate for representative committees, an opportunity to help improve life for the wider student population, while gaining valuable experience in critical professional areas like decision-making, teamwork and negotiation.</p>

<h2>Ghada Alshemaimry</h2>

<p>Saudi student Ghada Alshemaimry has chosen to follow her passion for computers and the internet to Australia and is now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology and Systems at Monash.</p>

<p>Ghada has settled well into Australian life and has found that meeting friends has been the key to overcoming her homesickness.</p>

<p>She has joined a number of student clubs on campus, including the Monash Multicultural Club and the Monash IT Club, and, at just 22, is now a leader among the student population. She has served as head of the Monash Saudi Female Students Club and is editor-in-chief of Saudi student magazine, Saudi Oz.</p>
