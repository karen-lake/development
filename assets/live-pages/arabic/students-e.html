<p>Monash helps students settle into university life by providing an extensive range of support programs and services, many of them designed specifically for international students.</p>  

<h2>Airport pick-up service</h2>

<p>Commencing students can pre-book our free airport pick-up service prior to arriving in Melbourne. This service lets students get to their nominated place of accommodation as quickly and easily as possible after touching down.</p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>We offer assistance with temporary accommodation and advice about off-campus housing options. Living on campus can be a good option for students who have never lived out of home. More than 2000 students access our on-campus accommodation, which provides the benefit of live-in staff 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<h2>Orientation</h2>

<p>Our orientation service incorporates a series of programs to help students adjust to a new country, and find their way around campus, not to mention the surrounding community. Activities include visiting the local supermarket, using public transport, being introduced to a peer mentor, social events and friendship programs.</p>

<h2>Academic support</h2>

<p>During their studies, students have access to academic support programs to improve written and oral expression, reading, listening and note-taking skills. Tutors are available to guide advanced students through research methodology, conference presentation and the best way of submitting academic papers.</p>

<h2>Careers counselling</h2>

<p>We also offer individual careers counselling, host career seminars and employer information sessions, as well as providing programs to assist job hunting and resume building.</p>
 
<h2>Student Service Centres</h2>

<p>Student Service Centres are located on all campuses. Our Service Centre staff can answer questions about admissions, enrolment, fees, examinations, scholarships, graduations, student visas and health care.</p>

<h2>The Monash University Islamic Society (MUIS)</h2>

<p>The MUIS provides a Muslim students' representative body on a number of our campuses. It runs various activities, among them Islamic study circle, Arabic classes, lectures, seminars and social gatherings.</p>

<p>The MUIS holds Iftar every Friday on campus during the month of Ramadan.</p>

<p>The Islamic Society is open to Muslims and non-Muslims who are interested in increasing their knowledge of Islam and receiving peer support.</p>
<h2>Salaam Monash</h2>
<p>We recognise that Muslim students have specific social, religious and cultural
  needs. The university publishes Salaam Monash, a resource handbook for new
  Muslim students in Victoria to assist students settle and adjust to life in
  Australia.</p>
<p>You can view a digital version of the handbook <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/international/studentservices/salaam.pdf">online</a> (PDF,
  2.1 mb).</p>

<h2>Religious facilities in Melbourne and on campus</h2>

<p>There are many mosques and prayer centres throughout metropolitan Melbourne. Monash University also offers Muslim prayer rooms across its Victorian campuses. Tharaweeh and qiyamul layl prayers are performed at the Monash University mosque located adjacent to the Clayton campus. Tharaweeh prayers are open to male and female students. Eid prayer for Eid ul Fitr are conducted by the university mosque. Prayers are held on campus during Eid ul Adha.</p>

<h2>Halal food</h2>

<p>Halal products are clearly marked with a halal symbol and are available at food outlets on the Clayton and Parkville campuses, and nearby the Gippsland campus. 
Many groceries available in Melbourne shops and supermarkets are halal. Halal restaurants, take-away outlets, grocery stores, and butchers are also offered. The Salaam Monash booklet includes a list of these products.</p>

<h2>Muslim medical and dental practitioners</h2>

<p>The Salaam Monash booklet provides a list of male and female doctors and dentists who practice in suburbs throughout Melbourne.</p>
<h2>Tailored pathways</h2>
<p>We want to make the move to Monash University as smooth as we can for all
  of our students. That's one of the reasons why we offer numerous pathway programs
  which help prepare students who may not be quite ready to walk straight into
  a university degree.</p>
<p>Our alternative entry programs – Monash University Foundation Year (MUFY),
  Monash College, and Monash University English Language Centre (MUELC) – prepare
  students for success in our challenging bachelor and honours degrees, diplomas,
  postgraduate coursework degrees, advanced research degrees and PhD programs.</p>
</div><!--End text-column-short-->

<div class="text-column-short">

<p>MUFY and Monash College are ideal for students looking to bridge the gap between their current qualifications and the academic qualifications required for entry into a Monash course. In addition to the benefits of small classes and personalised support, once students have successfully completed a Foundation Year or diploma program, they may then be able to move into a Monash University place.</p>

<p>MUELC provides the expertise, resources and facilities for students to undertake independent study and improve their English language skills.</p>

<h2>Meznah Ali Bin Abbad Alabdooli</h2>

<p>"My expectations of Monash College have been met so far, thus I am sure my expectations of Monash University will be met. I expected the teachers to deliver the lectures in an enthusiastic, approachable way, and they did. This helped a better understanding of the subjects."</p>
