<p>Australia is a harmonious society, a community comprising people from almost every nation on earth. It has a long-held reputation for welcoming international students and providing them with memorable study experiences.</p>

<p>The country's standard of living is among the highest in the world, with first class education, health care, public transport, employment rates, safety and security. The cost of living is also relatively low compared with similar economies in North America and Europe.</p>

<h2>Victoria</h2>

<p>The state of Victoria is located in south-eastern Australia.</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as "The Garden State" thanks to its abundance of parkland, Victoria sits well below the Tropic of Capricorn, and enjoys a temperate climate with temperatures sometimes touching 40 degrees Celcius at the height of summer.</p>

<h2>Melbourne and its Middle Eastern communities</h2>

<p>The capital city of Victoria is Melbourne.</p>

<p>Defined by a blend of sophistication, sporting passion, culinary brilliance, as well as high-quality infrastructure and a safe environment, Melbourne is consistently ranked among the world's most liveable cities by the UK-based Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>

<p>Melbourne is famous for its cultural diversity. It's home to a large community of people from a Middle-Eastern background and their contribution to the city (as well as the state) has been profound.</p>

<p>In any area like food, for instance, Middle-Eastern fare has made a bold and lasting impression. Cuisines from countries such as Turkey and Lebanon are enjoyed throughout the state, and particularly on Sydney Road in the northern suburb of Brunswick, which has become famous in no small part thanks to its large population of Middle-Eastern restaurants and shops.</p>

<p>There is also a large Muslim community in Victoria. You can find mosques and prayer centres throughout metropolitan Melbourne (and at Monash University campuses).</p>
 
<p>You can find out more about services and facilities for Muslim students on the page <a href="students-e.html">Supporting our students</a>.</p>

<h3>Fares Al Shammari</h3>

<p>"The most important things I will take back [from Monash will be] knowledge, skills and attitude.</p>

<p>"By attitude I mean how people live in a society like Australia, where people respect one another.</p>

<p>"You find just sitting on the train there will be a guy from India, a guy from China, and an Aussie guy and they are all sitting together, no discrimination.</p>

<p>"This is the life, to all sit together."</p>
