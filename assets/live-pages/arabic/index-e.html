<h2>An overview</h2>

<p>Monash is Australia's largest university and one of its most prestigious. Possessing an international reputation for the high quality of our research and teaching, we are ranked among the top 50 universities in the world<span class="subscript">*</span>.</p>

<p>But success can't be measured by ratings alone. We don't want to be defined just by numbers, but also by our ability to provide students with a rounded education, preparing them for the very specific challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.</p>

<p>Monash encompasses eight campuses and one education centre across four continents.</p>
 
<p>Award-winning educators and researchers lead our 10 specialised faculties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Art and Design</li>
<li>Arts</li>
<li>Business and Economics</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Engineering</li>
<li>Information Technology</li>
<li>Law</li>
<li>Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences</li>
<li>Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences</li>
<li>Science</li>
</ul>

<p>Course options within these faculties include single and double bachelors and honours degrees, diplomas, postgraduate coursework degrees, advanced research degrees, and PhDs.</p>

<p>More than 21,000 of our 60,000 students are international students. When they come to Monash, they come to a university that lets them pursue their academic interests in an enjoyable, safe and engaging environment. We do that by providing world-class facilities, as well as an extensive array of support services, many tailored specifically to international students.</p>
