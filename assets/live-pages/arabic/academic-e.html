<p>Monash University is the professional home to some of Australia's leading teachers and researchers.  Drawing on a mix of specialist knowledge and international experience, the University equips students with the skills and experience to excel globally.</p>

<p>Monash staff include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eight current Federation Fellows and three Australia Fellows, the most prestigious research awards in Australia</li>
<li>The Commonwealth Science Minister's Life Scientist of the Year (2009)</li>
<li>Recipients of the prestigious Young Tall Poppy Awards</li>
</ul>

<p>We are also proud to employ four Prime Minister's University Teacher of the Year Award winners, one of whom is Professor Stephen Barkoczy.</p>

<h2>Professor Stephen Barkoczy</h2>

<p>An expert in taxation law, superannuation law and venture capital law, Professor Stephen Barkoczy is a prime example of the dedication and expertise of our educators.</p>

<p>"I make an effort to bring the issues I come across through my consulting and researching into the classroom.  In my advanced tax classes, we often work from the documents back to the law rather than concentrate purely on theory.  I try to make it real for the students and get them to think laterally and creatively about how the law is applied," Professor Barkoczy said.</p>

<h2>Nobel Prize Winners</h2>

<h3>2007 Nobel Peace Prize</h3>

<p>Eight scientists from Monash University shared in the prestige of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.  </p>
<p>The prize was awarded to members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
  Change (IPCC) and environment campaigner Al Gore "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."</p>
